# Advanced Algorithm Lab - 8th Semester

Welcome to the repository for the Advanced Algorithm Lab of the 8th semester, 4th year. Here, you'll find implementations of various algorithms in both Python and C programming languages.

## List of Implemented Algorithms

This repository contains implementations for the following algorithms:

1. **Merge Sort**: An efficient, comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the array into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges them.
2. **Quick Sort**: Another efficient, comparison-based sorting algorithm that partitions the array around a pivot element and recursively sorts the subarrays.
3. **Find Two Elements Summing to X**: Given a sorted array and a number X, find two elements of the array such that their sum is X.
4. **Count Occurrences of X in a Sorted Array**: Given a sorted array and a number X, write a function that counts the occurrences of X in the array.
5. **Binary Search using Divide and Conquer**: An efficient searching algorithm that repeatedly divides the search interval in half.
6. **Greedy Algorithm for Fractional Knapsack Problem**: A greedy algorithm to solve the fractional knapsack problem, where items can be broken into smaller pieces.
7. **Find Largest and Smallest Number in an Array using Divide & Conquer**: Using the divide and conquer principle to find both the largest and smallest number in an array simultaneously.
8. **Greedy Algorithm for Job Sequencing with Deadlines**: A greedy algorithm to solve the problem of job sequencing with deadlines, where each job has a deadline and profit associated with it.
9. **Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication Strategy for Odd Dimensional Square Matrices**: An algorithm for matrix multiplication that is faster than the naive approach for large matrices.
10. **KMP String Matching**: Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm for substring searching in linear time.
11. **Dynamic Programming Strategy for Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: A dynamic programming approach to solve the classic traveling salesman problem, finding the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the original city.

## Usage

1. **C Programs**: Compile each C file separately using a C compiler like GCC. Then run the compiled executable.
   ```gcc -o output_file_name source_file_name.c```

3. **Python Programs**: Run Python scripts using Python interpreter.
   ```python script_name.py```
